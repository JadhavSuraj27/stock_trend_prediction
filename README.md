# Stock Price and Trend Prediction Tool
## Introduction
Every day, the stock market makes headlines. Every time it hits a new high or a new low, you hear about it. If an effective algorithm could be established to anticipate the short-term price of a single stock, the rate of investment and business opportunities in the stock market may increase.
Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks have been used in the past to predict stock prices, with a 20 percent error loss on average.
In this paper, we'll look at whether a Recurrent Neural Network-based model can be used to predict stock price with a lower percentage of inaccuracy.

There are a variety of models in the market that are attempting to create a resource and provide predictability to the majority of it, but everything is not the same, and the results are not perfect. The efficiency fluctuates with the stock market and its forecasting.
The project's main objective was to create and test the following method of computing. The first is data extraction, which is accomplished by removing data and its pieces from a database or dataset. The training from the source is completed and classified in the second flow. During this time, the same supervision is carried out, and the final step is the generation of the yield, which offers the outcome after computation.
